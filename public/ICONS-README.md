# PWA Icons Required

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create the following icon files in this directory:

## Required Icons:

1. **pwa-192x192.png** - 192x192 pixels
   - Standard PWA icon for Android
   - Should be a square icon with your tasbih app logo

2. **pwa-512x512.png** - 512x512 pixels
   - Larger PWA icon for Android and desktop
   - Used for splash screens and high-res displays
   - Can be marked as "maskable" for Android adaptive icons

3. **apple-touch-icon.png** - 180x180 pixels
   - iOS home screen icon
   - Should have rounded corners already included in the image
   - iOS will add its own mask/rounded corners

4. **favicon.ico** - 32x32 pixels (already exists, but should be updated)
   - Browser tab icon

## Icon Design Recommendations:

- **Theme**: Islamic/prayer related (tasbih beads, mosque, crescent, etc.)
- **Colors**: Use the app's primary color (#059669 - green)
- **Style**: Simple, recognizable, works well at small sizes
- **Background**: For maskable icons, ensure important content is within the safe zone (80% of the canvas)

## Temporary Placeholder:

For now, the app will work without these icons, but PWA installation and appearance will be improved once you add them.
